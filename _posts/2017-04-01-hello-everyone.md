We’re very excited to be launching our website! This project has gone through some tremendous folks full of talent and drive to make “Project Triage” a reality. When MassDiGI was approached by Yale to help develop “project Triage” we saw the value of how far this project can go, revolutionizing education itself for Medical Professionals.

Right now we’re in a closed beta and are receiving feedback from professionals in the field to insure the accuracy, educational value and quality are to the standard we set for ourselves. If you’d like to try out the simulator and provide feedback please email jumpstarttriage@gmail.com.

We’ve already got some incredible functionality built into the game such as assessing and helping victims as you pass them and we’ve got some incredible things planned for the future; this is just the beginning!

So please come back and check frequently! Thank you for coming to our website!
