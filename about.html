<p>Project Triage is an on-demand application that authentically simulates a disaster. It trains first responders to correctly act in a real situation! We've also incorporated the Project Triage algorythm for response.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Currently our simulation includes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A full 3D environment.</li>
  <li>Multiple victims.</li>
  <li>Ability to assess.</li>
  <li>Use different types of equipment on victims.</li>
  <li>Tagging victims with color.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>However we've only just begun!</h3>
<p>In the future, we will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiplayer.</li>
  <li>More Scenarios.</li>
  <li>More Environments.</li>
  <li>Different Roles.</li>
  <li>Interchangeable Parameters .</li>
</ul>

<p>It is our mission to make a simulation that will encompass all the elements of responding to a disaster. Allowing us to improve the training of future emergency responders.</p>
